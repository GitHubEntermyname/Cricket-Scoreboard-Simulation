# 🏏 Cricket Scoreboard Simulation

### 📌 Overview
This project is a **console-based cricket scoreboard simulator** written in **C++**.  
It allows users to set up two teams, simulate a toss, play two innings, and view a match summary — all through interactive terminal inputs.

### ⚙️ Features
- Team setup with custom player names (up to 11 per team)  
- Toss simulation with batting/bowling decision  
- First and second innings tracking  
- Player selection for striker, non-striker, and bowlers  
- Match summary display at the end  
- Interactive prompts and formatted output

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Language: **C++**  
- Libraries: `<iostream>`, `<string>`, `<conio.h>`, `<ctime>`, `<fstream>`  
- Platform: Windows console (uses `getch()` and `system("cls")`)

- `README.md` → project documentation  

### 🚀 How It Works
1. User enters team names and player lists.  
2. Toss is simulated with batting/bowling choice.  
3. First inning is played with striker/non-striker selection.  
4. Second inning follows with similar setup.  
5. Match summary is displayed at the end.

### 🙌 Acknowledgment
Developed as part of my **Mechatronics Engineering coursework**, showcasing interactive programming, logic flow, and user-driven simulation in C++.
